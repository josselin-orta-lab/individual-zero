# I1 PR #245 continuation: temperament and birth path

Source: development branch `feat/i1-natural-integrated-recovery-20261016`. No source files in original I0 or shared Lab modified.

- Canonical `I1Runtime` now supplies the immutable Stage11 temperament projection used by its own unknown-affordance evaluator, fixing the previous missing-property access.
- `i1_birth_temperament.py` deterministically derives five independent traits from the I1 life identifier and uses the existing Stage5 mapping to freeze the projected parameters in Stage11Config before birth. The full changed config is included by the existing I1 M11 runtime-contract hash; it cannot legitimately change across cold recovery.
- `i1_birth.py` provides one direct public factory `birth_i1` that constructs a mortal I1, without requiring historical H1/H2/D2 research-arm flags or extra opt-ins.
- Stage10 consolidation **still declines active-form publication** requiring unimplemented owner-specific verified post-cut replay. This guard must not be bypassed: the slow history can still retain private provenance but not invent live skills or duplicate TD updates.
- No software tests, executions, or scientific validation have been performed. Factory runtime compatibility remains unverified, and a separate coherent M11 SQLite birth factory requires validation. Keep PR draft and issue open.
